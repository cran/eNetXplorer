2019-04-16 Julian Candia <julian.candia@nih.gov> version 1.0.2
	* expanded built-in quality function options for binomial and multinomial models.
        * expanded the Leukemia_miR.RData dataset to include both full and filtered datasets (to ensure data provenance and reproducibility).
        * added error-catching functions, so that if an error happens, results for completed alphas are returned. 
        * added n_lambda_eff to deal with glmnet convergence issues (where glmnet would return solutions for a subset of lambdas).
        * added suppressWarnings() call around arrows() in plotFeatureCaterpillar.R and plotFeatureCaterpillarMultinom.R 
        * added vignette.
        * updated man pages.
        * updated citation.     

2018-06-10 Julian Candia <julian.candia@nih.gov> version 1.0.1
	* added export option for p-value tables. 
	* added progress bar during computation of model predictions.
        * updated references.
        * fixed bug in plot feature heatmap code (issue with sparse pval matrix).
